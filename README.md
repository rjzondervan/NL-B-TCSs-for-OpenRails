# NL-B-TCSs-for-OpenRails
TCS scripts for Open Rails for Dutch and Belgian trains. These scripts will be open source, and may be customised for specific use.

At the moment we are awaiting further documentation by the Open Rails team on TCS scripting. The plans are however to provide the following TCS systems:

- ATB
- TBL1+
- Memor
- ETCS

Which will be provided in the following combinations:
- ATB
- ATB, Memor
- ATB, Memor, TBL1+
- ATB, Memor, TBL1+, ETCS
- ATB, ETCS
- TBL1+, Memor
- TBL1+, Memor, ETCS

As these files will be open source, it might be possible to combine the TCS-systems above with other systems in order to create a TCS script that is applicable for your desired type of train.

**NOTE:** the project in this repository is currently being planned, as the TCS function of OpenRails currently lacks documentation.
